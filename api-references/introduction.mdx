## Firefli API v1 🚀

Welcome to the Firefli Public API. This RESTful surface helps you automate workspace operations, sync activity, and power admin tooling. All endpoints return JSON and follow consistent success/error patterns.

<Tip>
  Each response mirrors the workspace configuration you are scoped to, so multi-workspace teams can build predictable automations.
</Tip>

### Authentication

Every request must include an `Authorization` header with a bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer firefli_your_api_key_here
```

Create keys in **Workspace → Settings → Public API** and store them in a secrets manager. Keys inherit the creator's permissions—create scoped keys per integration.

### Rate limits

<Warning>
  **Rate limits:** 100 requests/minute per API key. Bursts are smoothed with a leaky bucket—implement exponential backoff on 429 responses.
