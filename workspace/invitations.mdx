## Overview

When you log into Firefli, the first thing you'll see is the **Workspace Selector**. This is where you'll find all the workspaces you've created or been invited to.

<Info>
  If you don't see a workspace, contact the workspace admin to confirm your
  invite was sent and accepted.
