title: "Setting up Docker"
description: "In this guide, we'll walk you through installation and maintenance of your Firefli instance. For smaller groups, we recommend using Cloud as it is much easier to begin with. Larger groups or groups looking to heavily modify Firefli can consider Vercel too, but may benefit from self-hosting."
