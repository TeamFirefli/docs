## Summary

Fetch workspace sessions organized by date. Filter by date range and session category to find specific events.
Session 'status' returns are automatically updated every minute. By default, Firefli already runs the current statuses:

| **Status**  | **Description**                             |
| :---------  | :------------------------------------------ |
| ended       | Session has passed, and ended.              |
| in-progress | Session start time has been met.            |
| scheduled   | Session is upcoming.                        |
| missed      | Session passed with no assignments          |
